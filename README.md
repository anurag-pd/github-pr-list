# React + TypeScript + Vite

1. Make a .env file at root directory
2. Add VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN, VITE_GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo in the env file

This is a simple React App made using Typescript.

For a specified Repo this will pull all the PRs and list them in neat Faishon.

Bugs will be shown in RED, while enhancements will be shown in GREEN.

There are buttons to help filter label wise PR. On selecting any label, PR for only specified labels will show up.
